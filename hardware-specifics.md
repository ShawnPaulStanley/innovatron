A glass-box on top of the microscope lens.  

There will be separate compartments (probably 3).

Top-most compartment: LED Screen (exposed to outside).
Middle compartment: Wires and ESP 32 (has a hole on the side for air vents with fans.
Lowest compartment: Houses the camera, has a hole for the lens.  
```
